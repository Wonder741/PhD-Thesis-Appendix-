Thesis Appendix Repository: Smart Insole System, Data Processing, and Deep Learning for Plantar Pressure Analysis

Description:

This repository contains the complete codebase and hardware design files used in the appendix of my thesis. It supports the development, data processing, and evaluation of a smart insole system for plantar pressure analysis and gait-related research. The repository integrates data preprocessing pipelines, deep learning models, embedded firmware, visualization tools, and hardware design files, ensuring full reproducibility of the experimental methods and system implementation described in the thesis.

Contents include:
1. Python scripts for data preprocessing
Processing raw data from a 3D laser foot scanner and plantar force plate
Foot shape normalization, registration, and plantar pressure matrix preparation

2. Python scripts for deep learning model training
Model training and evaluation for plantar pressure distribution prediction
Includes data loading, preprocessing, training loops, and inference pipelines

3. Embedded C++ firmware (Arduino)
Firmware for Seeed Studio XIAO nRF52840 Sense
Real-time acquisition and BLE transmission of smart insole sensor data

4. Web-based BLE receiver
HTML and JavaScript implementation
Runs locally on a laptop as a web application to receive BLE data

5. Python visualization tools for the smart insole platform
Visualization of plantar pressure matrices and clinical data
Supports analysis and interpretation of sensor measurements

6. Hardware design files
Altium Designer schematic (.SchDoc) and PCB layout (.PcbDoc) files
Custom smart insole control board design

This repository is intended for research reproducibility, methodological transparency, and future extension of smart insole–based plantar pressure analysis systems.
